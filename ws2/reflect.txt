I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,

This workshop was a good review on how to implement the copy assignment
operator and the copy constructor for a class.

I also learned how to implement the move constructor and assignment
operator for a class. These member functions are really good for
increasing performance without chaning any implementation details.
Finally I learned about how to process text files and read them increasing
to a string.
