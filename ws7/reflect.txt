I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,
with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

I learned how to work with template functions from numeric to
calculate common mathematical operations. I also learned how
to pass in a lambda function to customize it even further.
These general algorithms are useful in certain situations and
save you from writing and maintaining the code.
