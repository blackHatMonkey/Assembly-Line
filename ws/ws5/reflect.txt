I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,
with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

I learned about how lambda expressions work and how to pass them to functions
as a parameter. Another thing I learned was how to forbid a class from
copying one of it's kind. I also got more practice with enums and how
to incorporate them to a project.
