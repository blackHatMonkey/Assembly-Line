I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,
with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

I learned how to design and implement some basic templates which take
different number of arguments. Another thing that I got to practice was
overloading the array index operator to return the value.

What I wanted was to work on a more chanllenging problem which could have
been sovled using templates.
