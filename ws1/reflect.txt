I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,
with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

In this workshop I learned how to access another variable from
another cpp file. Although I think this is rather dangrous I'm
sure there are cases where it is uselful.

Another feature that I learned is about static variables where
their lifetime is the lifetime of the program. Since these static
variables have internal linkage they are uselful within a unit.

I also learned how to handle the command line arguments provided by
the user. However I believe more practice is required for more
complicated scenarios.

NOTE:
The instructions of the workshop was not quite clear. This was especially
noticable about the STORED variables and MAX. In the future perhaps
diagrams and images could be provided to assist with understanding the
concepts. Also the output should have more than one case since it
is hard to test with only one case.
