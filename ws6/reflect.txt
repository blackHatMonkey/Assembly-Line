I confirm that the content of this file is created by me,
with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

In this workshop I learned how to properly implement pure virtual
functions from an abstract class hierarchy. I also practiced more
with a static class array which will get allocated only once. I got
more practice with handling exceptions and specifically sending
std::string error message.
